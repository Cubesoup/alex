		       Alex: A Lexical Analyser Generator

			       Version 2.0

			      8 August 2003


Alex is a Lex-like tool for generating Haskell scanners.  For complete
documentation, see the doc directory.

Alex version 2.0 has changed fairly considerably since version 1.x,
and the syntax is almost completely different.  For a detailed list of
changes, see the CHANGES file.

Alex is now covered by a BSD-Style licence; see the licence file in
the `doc' directory for details.

The sources are in the the `src' directory and the documentation in the `doc'
directory; various  examples are in the 'examples' subdirectory.

The source code in the 'src' and 'examples' directories is intended
for a Haskell 98 compiler with hierarchical modules.  It has been
tested with GHC 5.04.x and 6.0.x.
