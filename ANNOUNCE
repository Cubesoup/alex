I am pleased to announce version 2.2 of Alex, the lexical analyser
generator for Haskell.

Changes in Alex 2.2 vs. 2.1.0:

  * Requires Cabal 1.2
  * ByteString wrappers: use Alex to lex ByteStrings directly

Distributions can be obtained from Alex's home page:

  http://www.haskell.org/alex/

Alex is distributed under a BSD-style license.

Cheers,
        Simon
