Changes in Alex 2.1.0 vs. 2.0.1:

  * Switch to a Cabal build system: you need a recent version of Cabal
    (1.1.6 or later).  If you have GHC 6.4.2, then you need to upgrade
    Cabal before building Alex.  GHC 6.6 is fine.

  * Slight change in the error semantics: the input returned on error
    is before the erroneous character was read, not after.  This helps
    to give better error messages.
